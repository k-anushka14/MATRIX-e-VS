🗳️ Matrix-Themed Government-Grade Voting System

A secure, transparent, and futuristic e-voting platform designed for government-level elections.

This project leverages permissioned blockchain, Aadhaar/biometric authentication, end-to-end encryption  to ensure tamper-proof elections while empowering citizens to verify their votes without compromising secrecy. The Matrix-inspired UI adds a unique, engaging visualization for dashboards and awareness campaigns.

🌟 Key Features

🔐 Government-Grade Security: AES-256 encryption + Zero-Knowledge Proofs for secure and verifiable voting.

🪪 Robust Authentication: Aadhaar/eID + biometric + OTP ensures only eligible voters can vote.

 Dashboard Modes:

Matrix Mode – futuristic glitch visualization for transparency campaigns.

🌍 Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle millions of votes efficiently.

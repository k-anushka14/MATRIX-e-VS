🕶️ MATRIX e-VS

A Matrix-themed electronic voting system designed to make small-scale elections secure, verifiable, and futuristic.

MATRIX e-VS reimagines voting in a digital era. Instead of paper ballots or insecure online forms, it offers:

A modern, encrypted system that protects votes.

An admin dashboard for managing elections.

A Matrix-inspired user interface that feels innovative and futuristic.

Our goal is to provide a solution that is simple enough for hackathons and small communities, but has the potential to scale with advanced features in the future.
